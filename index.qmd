## At the core of reduction

I was really struck the first time I realized how the Latin motto I had heard since childhood: *"Mens sana in corpore sano"*, was actually a partial quotation used in 1861 by the Englishman John Hulley, as a motto for his Liverpool Athletic Club. In fact, it was extrapolated from a longer sentence by Juvenal poet: *"Orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano"* (Satire X, 356). Taken in its entirety, the statement has quite a different meaning than its widely used shortened version: for one thing, it revolved around prayer and not fitness!

I have seen this same dynamic (the meaning of words/phrases progressively detaching from the reality or from their originally intended purpose) at work also in the field of public policy, so I decided to dig deeper.

In fact, quoting Giovanni Gentile's "Sommario di pedagogia come scienza filosofica": *"Language is not a garment of thought: it is its own body"* [@garbini_uscire_2003, p3], i.e. language does not merely communicate our ideas to others, but it is also the tool of our thought, the wings for it to fly. <!-- La lingua non è veste del pensiero: è il suo corpo stesso. Possiamo avere pensieri oscuri e quindi una forma oscura; ma quello che è chiaro dentro è chiaro fuori, per la semplice ragione che il fuori è uguale al dentro.  (https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/sommario-di-pedagogia-come-scienza-filosofica_%28Croce-e-Gentile%29/) --> D'Auria put it in another way [@dauria_tua_2024], asserting that language is *"performative"*, in that it colors, deforms, produces reality. For this reason, it is necessarily a divisive instrument because, as soon as it is able to categorize, it is also capable of separating (good from bad, truth from lie, etc.). Knowledge itself, as much as it may scare the proponents of political correctness, lives on categories and categories, including linguistic ones, must precisely distinguish and correctly identify the ontological characteristics of what we are talking about.

### Research question \# 1

The important question is ***"WHY" does such a deviation from the original meaning of a word/sentence occur?***. Granted, languages evolve on their own, but it can also be subject to manipulation, as George Orwell's "1984" so powerfully depicted illustrating the rules and purpose of fictional Oceania nation's *newspeak*. The risks connected to this potential abuse of language are clearly laid out by Riccardo Garbini in his "Lessico - Uscire da Babele" [@garbini_uscire_2003, p.4] [^1]\
<!-- > In alcuni casi la deviazione del significato si evidenzia mediante la soppressione pura e semplice del termine (1984): in tali casi dunque l'analisi non insiste sull'aspetto riduzionista. Le deviazioni, laddove presenti, sono dettate soprattutto da intenti ideologici, ossia dalla sovrapposizione di una griglia interpretativa con maglie piuttosto rigide sui dati oggettivi della realtà. L'effetto della sovrapposizione di questa griglia interpretativa chiamata ideologia risulta in tal modo una riduzione del campo percettivo ed interpretativo della realtà. Per questa ragione le deviazioni semantiche sono state denominate 'riduzionismi'.  -->

[^1]: Annex to the Giuseppe Fioravanti's book [@fioravanti_pedagogia_2006]

> *In some cases the deviation of the meaning is evidenced by the pure and simple suppression of the term (1984): in such cases, therefore, the analysis does not insist on the reductionist aspect. **The deviations, where present, are dictated above all by ideological intentions, that is, by the superimposition of an interpretative grid with rather rigid meshes on the objective data of reality.** The effect of the superimposition of this interpretative grid called ideology thus results in a reduction of the perceptive and interpretative field of reality. For this reason semantic deviations have been called 'reductionisms'.*

### Research question \# 2

Assuming that we may, at least, form hypotheses on why this "reduction" occurs, **"HOW does the the deviation from reality (in the language common use) sparkle and then spread?"** Can we detect the mechanisms? 

### Research question \# 3

Besides investigating the origin, it would be equally important to ***understand the consequences of a lamented lessical approximation or reduction***.

## Methodological notes

This goes beyond my scope, but just to lay out some important elements ust recall

-   **Hermeneutics**: from Greek $ἑρμηνευτική (τέχνη)$ - hermeneutikè (téchne), deriving from the verb $ἑρμηνεύ$ (hermēneuō) - is the science and practice of ***interpretation***. Over history, it has been mainly applied to sacred or juridical texts. Two are the main approaches: 1. reconstructing the original intention of the authors 2. adapting the interpretation based on the person who receives the text

-   **exegesis**: from Greek $ἐξήγησις$ - *exégesis* - deriving from the verb $ἐξηγέομαι$ (*exegéomai, \~ bring out*) - indicates "studying to explain", but referring to the maximum level of depth is seeked (hence it is referred to sacred or normaitive texts for which every nuance can be poignant).

-   **philology**: from Greek $ϕιλολογία$ - *philologĭa* - composed from $φίλος$- *phìlos* and $λόγος$ - *lògos* - indicates literally interest/love for the word/reason. The term indicates the study of texts and their history, but changed a little with the Latin *philologia*, and later embraced the sense of 'love of literature'.

-   **linguistics**

## Essential list of rhetorical devices

### Adage

An *adage* is an ancient saying or maxim, brief and sometimes mysterious, that has become accepted as conventional wisdom. In classical rhetoric, an adage is also known as a *rhetorical proverb* or *paroemia*. Often it's a type of metaphor. It can express the values of a culture. [@nordquist_words_2018]

> **Example(s)**: "The early bird gets the worm", "Better late than never."

### Slogan

The English word *slogan* has a Scottish Gaelic origin and derives from the combination of *sluagh* (army) + *gairm* (shout), i.e. a "battle cry". Nowadays, it signifies a short, memorable and concise phrase used for marketing or political campaigns. Marketing slogans are often called *taglines* in the United States

> **Example(s)**: "...", "..."

## Issues of modern English

Below is the list of *red flags* detected in Orwell's "Politics and the English Language"[@orwell_politics_1946]:

-   **Dying metaphors**, or worn−out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves. <!-- GGentile la prima e piu evidente originalita del genio e' la potenza plasmatrice che egli possiede di quel che si dice il materiale linguistico -->
-   **Operators, or verbal false limbs**, which save the trouble of picking out appropriate verbs and nouns, and at the same time pad each sentence with extra syllables which give it an appearance of symmetry. Characteristic phrases are: render inoperative, militate against, prove unacceptable, make contact with, be subjected to, give rise to, give grounds for, having the effect of, play a leading part (role) in, make itself felt, take effect, exhibit a tendency to, serve the purpose of, etc.
-   **Pretentious diction** (used to dress up simple statements and give an air of scientific impartiality to biased judgments), foreign words and expressions, jargon 
-   **Meaningless words**, as in certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, where they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so by the reader (like romantic, plastic, values, human, dead, sentimental, natural, vitality), it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning. Many political words are similarly abused: The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice, have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. ***Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different.***

> Ma si possono riscontrare anche
>
> -   **statalismo**
> -   **burocraticismo**

> lo stesso linguaggio burocratico, che permea la scuola statale (impropriamente detta 'pubblica') italiana odierna, come diretta conseguenza dell'ideologia statalista presenta una forma che è «astratta, solenne, tecnicizzata, in funzione del prestigio e del potere che detiene il diffusore del messaggio. Da questa prassi consegue una sclerosi del pensiero che si sorregge sui trampoli di locuzioni fruste e cristallizzate. Ufficialità, reticenza e straniamento sono i caratteri che il messaggio assume nell'esercizio del potere. [@garbini_uscire_2003, p5]
