# Motivation

Through my professional journey as a consultant in multilateral and governmental institutions, I have been exposed to the phenomenon of **buzzwords**[^1], **catchphrases**[^2] and **slogans**[^3] that suddenly emerge in policy discussions, andâ€”at least for some timeâ€”take center stage in strategic planning.\
Notably, in the organizations I worked with (including World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, G20, EU, and the Italian Government) these catchphrases and slogans often turn into significant funding allocations, thus steering the prioritization of policies and programs. 

[^1]: **Buzzword**: The term probably originated in the 1940s as jargon used in business and marketing circles. More recently, it has taken on the meaning "fashionable jargon", especially common in business, technology, and politics, where they often signal innovation or forward-thinking but may lack clear, practical applications.
[^2]: **Catchphrase**: The notion is of a short phrase that will "catch" in the mind of the hearer. The word was used in the 1840s of a line of music that was easy to catch and remember. It describes, in the modern sense, a memorable, often simplistic phrase or expression that becomes widely recognized and associated with a particular individual, group, or concept. It is designed to stick in people's minds and to evoke a specific idea or emotion, usually through repetition in media, advertising, or popular culture.
[^3]: **Slogan**: from Gaelic *sluagh-ghairm*, i.e. "battle cry", used by Scottish Highland or Irish clans. The metaphoric sense of "distinctive word or phrase used by a political or other group" is attested from 1704. It still carries the connotation of a rallying cry, a motto, or a watchword, deliberately crafted to be persuasive, promote a cause or sell an idea.  
 
## Examples in the development economics arena

Drawing from my own professional experience in development economics, I recall the ebb and flow of trends in the popularity of several phrases. There are less recent examples (*"South-South Cooperation"*, *"Gender Mainstreaming"*, *"Results-Based Financing"*), phrases that are now are quintessential to the development discourse (*"Sustainable Development"*, *"ESG criteria"*) or that are a legacy from the Covid-19 crisis (*"Build back better"*, *"Resilient development"*, *"Green and blue economy"*). 

 
<!-- **OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT AID** -->

<!-- -   Boost shared prosperity -->
<!-- -   MFD (Maximizing Finance for Development) -->
<!-- -   PforR (Program for Results) -->
<!-- -   RBF (Results-Based Financing)  -->
<!-- -   RBA (Results-Based Aid) -->
<!-- -   Evidence-based policy <!-- + Cash on Delivery Aid 
<!--  + Private sector engagement --> <!-- 
<!--  + Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) --> 
<!--  + Blended finance -->

<!-- **INCLUSION** -->

<!-- -   South-South Cooperation -->
<!-- -   Gender Mainstreaming -->
<!-- -   Leave No One Behind -->
<!-- + Inclusive Growth --> 
<!-- + Focus on the "bottom billion" --> 
<!-- + End extreme poverty --> 
<!-- -   The Bottom Billion -->

<!-- **SUSTAINABILITY, ENVIRONMENT** -->

<!-- -   Sustainable Development -->
<!-- -   SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) -->
<!-- -   ESG (Environmental, social, and governance) *criteria* -->
<!-- -   Mainstreaming climate action -->
<!-- -   3 zeros *(0 poverty, 0 net carbon emissions, 0 net loss of natural capital)* -->
<!-- -   GRID (Green, Resilient, and Inclusive Development) -->
<!-- -   Build Back Better <!-- + Green growth / Green economy --> 
<!-- + Blue Economy --> <!-- + Green, Digital, and Fair  --> 
<!-- + Green and grey infrastructure --> 
<!-- + Circular Economy --> 

I've observed how similar formulaic expressions often make their way into project documentation and policy papers, quickly gaining tractionâ€”at times becoming pervasiveâ€”in both academic and professional discourse.  

This has led me to wonder how much consideration is given to the deliberate selection of such terms, or if they may simply be 'in vogue' and become a convenient shorthand for more complex ideas. Something that isnâ€™t so surprising when we consider the paradoxical effect of social media and their recommendation algorithms on the selection of news, posts and articles that we access. Rather than broadening our exposure, these algorithms tend to restrict it, reinforcing the *echo chamber* effect.

## ðŸŸ  The curious case of lexical reduction, modification or *domestication*

An element that makes this investigation even more intriguing is that, often, the meaning of words and phrases progressively detaches from reality and/or from their originally intended meaning, while some *revised meaning* (more or less explicit) starts to live on a journey of its own.\
For example, I was really struck as I realized how the Latin motto I had heard since childhood: *"Mens sana in corpore sano"*, was actually a partial quotation adopted in 1861 by the Englishman John Hulley as a motto for his Liverpool Athletic Club. In fact, it was extrapolated from a longer sentence by Juvenal poet: *"Orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano"* (Satire X, 356). Taken in its entirety, the original statement has quite a different meaning than its more famous shortened version: for one thing, it is about prayer, not fitness!

A similar reduction is clearly relevant and consequence-ridden if, as Giovanni Gentile pointed out in *"Sommario di pedagogia come scienza filosofica"*: "Language is not a garment of thought: it is thought's own body", i.e. language does not merely communicate our ideas to others, but it is also the tool of our thought, it provides wings for it to fly [@garbini_uscire_2003, p3]. <!-- La lingua non Ã¨ veste del pensiero: Ã¨ il suo corpo stesso. Possiamo avere pensieri oscuri e quindi una forma oscura; ma quello che Ã¨ chiaro dentro Ã¨ chiaro fuori, per la semplice ragione che il fuori Ã¨ uguale al dentro.  (https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/sommario-di-pedagogia-come-scienza-filosofica_%28Croce-e-Gentile%29/) --> Similarly, Luca D'Auria asserts that "language is *performative*", in that it colors, deforms, produces reality [@dauria_tua_2024]. For this reason, it is necessarily a divisive instrument because, as soon as it is able to categorize, it is also capable of separating (good from bad, truth from lie, etc.). Knowledge itself, much to the dismay of the proponents of *political correctness*, lives on categories and categories, including linguistic ones, must precisely distinguish and correctly identify the ontological characteristics of what we are talking about.

<!-- ## Issues of modern English -->

<!-- Below is the list of *red flags* detected in Orwell's "Politics and the English Language"[@orwell_politics_1946]: -->

<!-- -   **Dying metaphors**, or wornâˆ’out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves. <!-- GGentile la prima e piu evidente originalita del genio e' la potenza plasmatrice che egli possiede di quel che si dice il materiale linguistico -->

<!-- -   **Operators, or verbal false limbs**, which save the trouble of picking out appropriate verbs and nouns, and at the same time pad each sentence with extra syllables which give it an appearance of symmetry. Characteristic phrases are: render inoperative, militate against, prove unacceptable, make contact with, be subjected to, give rise to, give grounds for, having the effect of, play a leading part (role) in, make itself felt, take effect, exhibit a tendency to, serve the purpose of, etc. -->

<!-- -   **Pretentious diction** (used to dress up simple statements and give an air of scientific impartiality to biased judgments), foreign words and expressions, jargon  -->

<!-- -   **Meaningless words**, as in certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, where they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so by the reader (like romantic, plastic, values, human, dead, sentimental, natural, vitality), it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning. Many political words are similarly abused: The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice, have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. ***Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different.*** -->

<!-- > Ma si possono riscontrare anche -->

<!-- > -->

<!-- > -   **statalismo** -->

<!-- > -   **burocraticismo** -->

<!-- > lo stesso linguaggio burocratico, che permea la scuola statale (impropriamente detta 'pubblica') italiana odierna, come diretta conseguenza dell'ideologia statalista presenta una forma che eÌ€ Â«astratta, solenne, tecnicizzata, in funzione del prestigio e del potere che detiene il diffusore del messaggio. Da questa prassi consegue una sclerosi del pensiero che si sorregge sui trampoli di locuzioni fruste e cristallizzate. UfficialitaÌ€, reticenza e straniamento sono i caratteri che il messaggio assume nell'esercizio del potere. [@garbini_uscire_2003, p5] -->

## So what?

For a while now, I have wondered *why* and *how* certain catchphrases/slogans/buzzwords become so prevalent in a given public policy context at some specific point in time.\
The problem is that if you are (as I was) just a cog in very complex institutional machine, it is difficult to capture the (often intangible) dynamics of this process.\
Therefore, I decided to investigate this phenomenon with a "reverse engineering" approach, starting from the *corpora* of documents themselves to see if I could identify some patterns or trends over time. Head over to [this page](https://lulliter.github.io/slogan/research/hypotheses.html#sec-RQ) to see my specific research questions. 

## Why focus on the World Bank?

The World Bank simply presented, from my point of view, a convenient "study case" because:

1. Its documents (related to lending projects and other publications) are available and openly accessible.
2. The Bank has a long history and a vast amount of digitized documents, which allows for a longitudinal analysis.
3. The Bank's sectorial and thematic coverage is very broad, which allows for an interesting analysis.
4. Last but not least, I am familiar with the Bank's documents' nature, structure and jargon, having worked there for several years.
