Such a book could become a vehicle for the Bank to lead, to propagate its ideas, to mobilize official development assistance, and to win adherence for a renewed push to develop. [@yusuf_development_2008]\n\n# OVERARCHING RESEARCH QUESTION\n\n## What is the purpose of WDRs?\n\n-   \n\n    a)  a trend-follower (\"synthesizing the \"truth\" as it was revealed\")? or\n\n-   \n\n    b)  a policy trend-maker (\"vehicle for the Bank to lead\")\n\n## Is it an observation of what is emerging as important?\n\n> The topics not only provide a window on the Bank's perception of what mattered or matters in the sphere of development at a particular time, but also give an indicator of the current fashions in development econom- ics that are attracting a significant amount of attention from researchers. [@yusuf_development_2008, p.35]\n\n## Or is it a vehicle to push an agenda?\n\n> With the publication of the first of an annual series, the Bank took it upon itself to try to filter and systematize the knowledge on development so as to enhance the operational utility of such knowledge. In producing the WDR, the Bank was not seeking intellectual leadership or attempting to break new ground in the development field. Instead, the WDR was seen as a vehicle for persuading the Bank's member governments to broadly unite behind a strategy and to cooperate in making it succeed. [@yusuf_development_2008, p.34]\n\n> The three best remembered WDRs are those on fertility, on poverty, and on health. + The ***1984 fertility report*** took the previously standard, though even then rapidly fading, view that population growth was indeed a problem for economic development, that more mouths meant less for each (the lump fallacy), and that the \"tragedy of the commons\" meant that the individual decisions of parents about their fertility were unlikely to lead to good outcomes. [... ] the Bank dropped the issue after the report, and indeed the tide was turning against the international population control movement from the mid-1980s on. Yet much harm had already been done, as documented in Matthew Connelly's (2008) Fatal Misconceptions [...]. + The ***1990 poverty report*** is famous for introducing the international dollar-a-day poverty standard and the associated counts. These counts have continued to date, regularly updated by Martin Ravallion and his team, who were also the original authors. They have had an immense effect on development practice and on development debate, not least through the use of the dollar-a-day standard to define the first of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the appointment of the Bank as the subsequent scorekeeper. + The ***1993 WDR on health*** is also famous, mostly for its introduction of the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), although this concept and its subsequent sweeping of the world is attributable less to Bank researchers than to Chris Murray, who was a consultant to the WDR. The DALY, like the dollar-a-day standard, has become a central tool of health measurement around the world for computing the burden of disease associated with different conditions, for permitting a combination of mortality and morbidity, and for assigning priorities. But the 1993 WDR, more than any other Bank report, put the Bank on the map as a major player in global health. It is also famous for reputedly persuading Bill Gates that international health was important, certainly an excellent example of the WDR mobilizing global opinion and shaping strategy. [Angus Deaton in @yusuf_development_2008]\n\n... the World Development Indicators (WDI), later spun off into an immensely successful stand-alone product.\n\n## Or both? (or one then the other at different points?)\n\nBoth\n\nAccording to Kemal Derviş, more than politics and political ideology what influenced a lot the WRDs shifting emphasis over time has been academic thinking. [Kemal Derviş in @yusuf_development_2008]\n\n## Is is more about ideas or facts?\n\nSomething new in the 1970s (not inundated by facts as we are today),\n\n> the World Bank used its resources and its access to data to generate a decent statistical picture of development. For the first time, many statements on the dynamics of development could be buttressed by facts. For the first time, readers were given a good sense of the magnitudes involved, and this insight was vital for determining the scale of problems and for calibrating policies. In effect, the WDRs helped to make development economics more numerate and altered the nature of discourse.

And the poor are not significantly contributing to growth.\" McNamara called for an eradication of absolute poverty by the end of the 20th century, and he indicated that essential to accomplishing this goal would be an *increase in the productivity of **small-scale agriculture***.\n    -   ***basic needs***\n    -   ***pro-poor policies*** (1980 WDR---the Bank's first report on poverty, stressed the importance of managing health, education, and population growth)\n    -   (after second energy shock) ***macroeconomic stability and resource equilibrium***\n    -   ***structural adjustments*** was seen as vital to ridding the economy of many distorting regulatory encrustations, shrinking the state, and (most important) optimizing the allocation of resources by getting the prices right---one of the enduring mantras of the 1980s and emblematic of the notorious \"Washington Consensus\"\n\n### [- 1980s - pendulum shifts to market-based system that scaled down the role of the state in a globalizing environment]{.underline}\n\n    -   ***market-based economics*** began to dominate, echoing a similar change in mindset among mainstream American academics. *Anne Krueger*, who replaced Hollis Chenery, was a staunch advocate of market solutions, and by prevailing over the views of her peers in the manage- ment group, she hitched the Bank's approach to development firmly to market forces.\n    -   ***Tax and public sector reform*** **and *privatization***, quite suddenly, became immensely popular with policy makers,13 not the least because public sector deficits in some industrial countries made greater revenue effort a matter of urgency.\n    -   ***Freer trade***---already promoted by the Kennedy and Tokyo Rounds and the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade---was boosted by the ambitious Uruguay Round launched in 1986\n    -   ***ODA, private resources, FDI***\n\n### [- 1990s - growth and poverty, analyzing them from microeconomic, institutional, and sectoral perspectives]{.underline}\n\n    -   redefining the role of the ***state*** , identifying missing institutions, proposing blueprints for these institutions\n    -   ***regulatory*** responsibilities\n    -   \"***50 years is enough***,\" protests against the Bretton Woods Institutions, civil society\n    _ emphasis shifted to ***micro*** issues (framing and testing of narrow hypotheses and are greatly preoccupied with the minutiae of economic plumbing)\n    -   ***access to knowledge*** ( Stiglitz) - In a globalizing world, information, information technologies, the Internet, and institutions that were transforming the sharing of information had become as intrinsic to growth as physical capital, opening a whole new range of opportunities for developing countries and at the same time bringing them face to face with a fresh sheaf of policy issues.\n    -   1999/00 four major forces---***globalization*** arising from flows of trade, capital, people and ideas; ***climate and environmental changes***; localization stemming from the combined effects of ***fiscal and administrative decentralization***; and ***rapid urbanization***\n    -   PPPs\n    - growth could be made ***environmentally friendly*** (WDRs 1992, 2003, )\n\n### [- 2000s - emphasis on institutions that affect market functioning and the entry, innovativeness, and growth of firms]{.underline}\n\n-   ***governance*** of regulatory bodies\n-   ***information gaps and asymmetries***---the cause of market failures and countless economic ills.\n-   concern over **barriers to the entry and functioning of firms**, created in part by regulations that curtailed competition.\n-   ***investment climate***\n\n## Looking at titles:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## >>> Looking at subjects \n\n`01c_WDR_data-exploration_subjects.Rmd` .....\n\n\n# How have WDRs \"winning ideas\" prevailed over time?\n\n\n## viz x-> Frequency of words within subsets of topics\n\nIt could be interesting to verify whether among those WDRs that focused on the same general topic, the choice of words has changed.
