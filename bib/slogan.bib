  abstract = {A key question of collective social behavior is related to the influence of mass media on public opinion. Different approaches have been developed to address quantitatively this issue, ranging from field experiments to mathematical models. In this work we propose a combination of tools involving natural language processing and time series analysis. We compare selected features of mass media news articles with measurable manifestation of public opinion. We apply our analysis to news articles belonging to the 2016 US presidential campaign. We compare variations in polls (as a proxy of public opinion) with changes in the connotation of the news (sentiment) or in the agenda (topics) of a selected group of media outlets. Our results suggest that the sentiment content by itself is not enough to understand the differences in polls, but the combination of topics coverage and sentiment content provides an useful insight of the context in which public opinion varies. The methodology employed in this work is far general and can be easily extended to other topics of interest.},

  abstract = {This paper highlights the relationship between economic science and Christian moral in order to analyze the idea of socio-economic development promoted by the Catholic Social Teaching (CST). In the first period leading up to the Second Vatican Council (1891-1962), from Pope Leo XIII to Pope John XXIII, the idea of development was connected both to technical and industrial progress, and to the universal values of justice, charity, and truth, which national communities were asked to follow. During the Conciliar period (1962-1979), the concept of development assumes a social and economic dimension, and so it becomes one of the main pillars of Catholic Social Teaching, which introduces the earliest definition of integral human development. Ultimately, in the post-Conciliar phase (1979-2009) including Benedict XVI's pontificate, the idea of integral human development reaches its maturity by incorporating the complexity of real-world economic interactions. Finally, this paper shows how the ethics bolstered by the Catholic Social Teaching is characterized by two distinct but complementary lines of thought: moral rules for both political action, and for socio-economic issues.},

  abstract = {A fundamental goal of scientific research is to learn about causal relationships. However, despite its critical role in the life and social sciences, causality has not had the same importance in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which has traditionally placed more emphasis on predictive tasks. This distinction is beginning to fade, with an emerging area of interdisciplinary research at the convergence of causal inference and language processing. Still, research on causality in NLP remains scattered across domains without unified definitions, benchmark datasets and clear articulations of the remaining challenges. In this survey, we consolidate research across academic areas and situate it in the broader NLP landscape. We introduce the statistical challenge of estimating causal effects, encompassing settings where text is used as an outcome, treatment, or as a means to address confounding. In addition, we explore potential uses of causal inference to improve the performance, robustness, fairness, and interpretability of NLP models. We thus provide a unified overview of causal inference for the computational linguistics community.},

It analyses the language used in a variety of situations, including news reporting, interviews, rules and regulations, even such apparently innocuous language as the rhymes on greetings cards.

We posit that recent work in machine learning and explainable AI provide tools that enable insights into the decisions from a given peer-review process. We start by simulating the peer-review process using an ML classifier and extracting global explanations in the form of linguistic features that affect the acceptance of a scientific paper for publication on an open peer-review dataset. Second, since such global explanations do not justify causal interpretations, we propose a methodology for detecting confounding effects in natural language and generating explanations, disentangled from textual confounders, in the form of lexicons. Our proposed linguistic explanation methodology indicates the following on a case dataset of ICLR submissions: a) the organising committee follows, for the most part, the recommendations of reviewers, and b) the paper's main characteristics that led to reviewers recommending acceptance for publication are originality, clarity and substance.},

In this paper we present mixed-method analyses to investigate causal influences of publication trends and behavior on the adoption, persistence and retirement of certain research foci -- methodologies, materials, and tasks that are of interest to the computational linguistics (CL) community. Our key findings highlight evidence of the transition to rapidly emerging methodologies in the research community (e.g., adoption of bidirectional LSTMs influencing the retirement of LSTMs), the persistent engagement with trending tasks and techniques (e.g., deep learning, embeddings, generative, and language models), the effect of scientist location from outside the US e.g., China on propensity of researching languages beyond English, and the potential impact of funding for large-scale research programs.

Reviews of this policy domain mostly either refer to general issues without deep immersion into details or focus on specific narrower aspects. The paper uses semantic analysis to identify major themes of science, technology and innovation policies over the last three decades and to trace their evolution towards current policy setting. We use semantic tools for processing and analysing documents produced by one of the major and highly reputable international expert bodies, the OECD Working Party on Technology and Innovation Policy. We show that selected themes remain in the mainstream even though being affected by regular policy adjustments and refinements and which disappear or appear with new challenges and expected solutions. Other themes appear niche or exotic themes which are under discussion for some time only.},

  abstract = {Political scientists lack methods to efficiently measure the priorities political actors emphasize in statements. To address this limitation, I introduce a statistical model that attends to the structure of political rhetoric when measuring expressed priorities: statements are naturally organized by author. The expressed agenda model exploits this structure to simultaneously estimate the topics in the texts, as well as the attention political actors allocate to the estimated topics. I apply the method to a collection of over 24,000 press releases from senators from 2007, which I demonstrate is an ideal medium to measure how senators explain their work in Washington to constituents. A set of examples validates the estimated priorities and demonstrates their usefulness for testing theories of how members of Congress communicate with constituents. The statistical model and its extensions will be made available in a forthcoming free software package for the R computing language.},

Word embeddings show promise as a diachronic tool, but have not been carefully evaluated. We develop a robust methodology for quantifying semantic change by evaluating word embeddings (PPMI, SVD, word2vec) against known historical changes. We then use this methodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using six historical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose two quantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity---the rate of semantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) the law of innovation---independent of frequency, words that are more polysemous have higher rates of semantic change.},

Thanks to this, for the first time, it became possible to analyze evolution of language through the use of automatic approaches. In this paper, we show the results of an exploratory analysis aiming to investigate methods for studying and visualizing changes in word meaning over time. In particular, we propose a framework for exploring semantic change at the lexical level, at the contrastive-pair level, and at the sentiment orientation level. We demonstrate several kinds of NLP approaches that altogether give users deeper understanding of word evolution. We use two diachronic corpora that are currently the largest available historical language corpora. Our results indicate that the task is feasible and satisfactory outcomes can be already achieved by using simple approaches.},

We illustrate the promises and challenges of this framework via a theoretical case study of the effect of an advocate's gender on interruptions from justices during U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments. We also discuss challenges conceptualizing and operationalizing causal variables such as gender and language that comprise of many components, and we articulate technical open challenges such as temporal dependence between language mediators in conversational settings.},

  abstract = {Every day, individuals post suicide notes on social media asking for support, resources, and reasons to live. Some posts receive few comments while others receive many. While prior studies have analyzed whether specific responses are more or less helpful, it is not clear if the quantity of comments received is beneficial in reducing symptoms or in keeping the user engaged with the platform and hence with life. In the present study, we create a large dataset of users' first r/SuicideWatch (SW) posts from Reddit (N=21,274), collect the comments as well as the user's subsequent posts (N=1,615,699) to determine whether they post in SW again in the future. We use propensity score stratification, a causal inference method for observational data, and estimate whether the amount of comments ---as a measure of social support--- increases or decreases the likelihood of posting again on SW. One hypothesis is that receiving more comments may decrease the likelihood of the user posting in SW in the future, either by reducing symptoms or because comments from untrained peers may be harmful. On the contrary, we find that receiving more comments increases the likelihood a user will post in SW again. We discuss how receiving more comments is helpful, not by permanently relieving symptoms since users make another SW post and their second posts have similar mentions of suicidal ideation, but rather by reinforcing users to seek support and remain engaged with the platform. Furthermore, since receiving only 1 comment ---the most common case--- decreases the likelihood of posting again by 14\% on average depending on the time window, it is important to develop systems that encourage more commenting.},

The speech transcripts are published on websites, social media, and documents in large volumes and multiple languages. These transcripts are available in unstructured textual format and thus they are a part of big-data requiring analytics to derive insights from it. In this experiment, a significantly large volume of speech transcripts are analyzed and graphical visualizations are generated such as Lexical Dispersion Plot, Time Series Plot, WordCloud, Bar-Graphs using various Python libraries. The study has been useful in identifying issues highlighted across a large number of speech transcripts. So far, the linguists have tried to perform analysis using manual linguistic approaches which are extremely time-consuming and complex to understand the Political Discourse. Our experiment of applying NLP based text analytics proves to be a very efficient technique for Political Discourse Analysis (PDA).},

For newcomers to a particular science domain (e.g., IR, physics, NLP) it is often difficult to spot larger trends and to position the latest research in the context of prior scientific achievements and breakthroughs. Similarly, researchers in the history of science are interested in tools that allow them to analyze and visualize changes in particular scientific domains. Temporal summarization and related methods should be then useful for making sense of large volumes of scientific discourse data aggregated over time. We demonstrate a novel approach to analyze the collections of research papers published over longer time periods to provide a high level overview of important semantic changes that occurred over the progress of time. Our approach is based on comparing word semantic representations over time and aims to support users in better understanding of large domain-focused archives of scholarly publications. As an example dataset we use the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus that spans from 1979 to 2015 and contains 22,878 scholarly articles.},

  abstract = {Word vectorization is an emerging text-as-data method that shows great promise for automating the analysis of semantics---here, the cultural meanings of words---in large volumes of text. Yet successes with this method have largely been confined to massive corpora where the meanings of words are presumed to be fixed. In political science applications, however, many corpora are comparatively small and many interesting questions hinge on the recognition that meaning changes over time. Together, these two facts raise vexing methodological challenges. Can word vectors trace the changing cultural meanings of words in typical small corpora use cases? I test four time-sensitive implementations of word vectors (               word2vec               ) against a gold standard developed from a modest data set of 161 years of newspaper coverage. I find that one implementation method clearly outperforms the others in matching human assessments of how public dialogues around equality in America have changed over time. In addition, I suggest best practices for using               word2vec               to study small corpora for time series questions, including bootstrap resampling of documents and pretraining of vectors. I close by showing that               word2vec               allows granular analysis of the changing meaning of words, an advance over other common text-as-data methods for semantic research questions.},

These comments have been automatically clustered and manually annotated to find protoslogans coming from the parties' supporters (bottom-up). We applied four layers of analysis: Nominal Utterances (NUs), a syntactic device widely used for slogans; Slogans for NUs with a slogan function; Top-down/Bottom-up, to recognize the slogans produced by the politicians and those produced by supporters; Protoslogans, for NUs devoid of specific political content while expressing partisanship and support for the leaders.},

In particular, we found that models misclassify on augmented sentences that have been negated or strengthened with respect to its causal meaning. This is worrying since minor linguistic differences in causal sentences can have disparate meanings. Therefore, we propose the generation of counterfactual causal sentences by creating contrast sets (Gardner et al., 2020) to be included during model training. We experimented on two model architectures and predicted on two out-of-domain corpora. While our strengthening schemes proved useful in improving model performance, for negation, regular edits were insufficient. Thus, we also introduce heuristics like shortening or multiplying root words of a sentence. By including a mixture of edits when training, we achieved performance improvements beyond the baseline across both models, and within and out of corpus' domain, suggesting that our proposed augmentation can also help models generalize.},

  abstract = {We introduce a procedure to examine a text-as-mediator problem from a novel randomized experiment that studied the effect of conversations on political polarization. In this randomized experiment, Americans from the Democratic and Republican parties were either randomly paired with one-another to have an anonymous conversation about politics or alternatively not assigned to a conversation --- change in political polarization over time was measured for all participants. This paper analyzes the text of the conversations to identify potential mediators of depolarization and is faced with a unique challenge, necessitated by the primary research hypothesis, that individuals in the control condition do not have conversations and so lack observed text data. We highlight the importance of using domain knowledge to perform dimension reduction on the text data, and describe a procedure to characterize indirect effects via text when the text is only observed in one arm of the experiment.},

  abstract = {Recent work has raised concerns on the risk of spurious correlations and unintended biases in statistical machine learning models that threaten model robustness and fairness. In this paper, we propose a simple and intuitive regularization approach to integrate causal knowledge during model training and build a robust and fair model by emphasizing causal features and de-emphasizing spurious features. Specifically, we first manually identify causal and spurious features with principles inspired from the counterfactual framework of causal inference. Then, we propose a regularization approach to penalize causal and spurious features separately. By adjusting the strength of the penalty for each type of feature, we build a predictive model that relies more on causal features and less on non-causal features. We conduct experiments to evaluate model robustness and fairness on three datasets with multiple metrics. Empirical results show that the new models built with causal awareness significantly improve model robustness with respect to counterfactual texts and model fairness with respect to sensitive attributes.},

We teach methods to support the entire analysis workflow, from data import and conversion, basic (linguistic) preprocessing to actual analysis such as key-term extraction, co-occurrence statistics, topic models and text classification. The use of the statistical programming language R for the workshop enables participants to learn about methodical backgrounds at different depths levels, as well as to meet their own specific analysis requirements. Among other things, this is possible by relying on a vast supply of community-developed extensions for (textual) data analysis, visualization, and presentation. In detail, we introduce R Markdown tutorial sheets as a didactic core component of the course, and how they can be extended to alternative teaching formats such as a text book for self-learners.},

  abstract = {Word evolution refers to the changing meanings and associations of words throughout time, as a byproduct of human language evolution. By studying word evolution, we can infer social trends and language constructs over different periods of human history. However, traditional techniques such as word representation learning do not adequately capture the evolving language structure and vocabulary. In this paper, we develop a dynamic statistical model to learn time-aware word vector representation. We propose a model that simultaneously learns time-aware embeddings and solves the resulting ``alignment problem''. This model is trained on a crawled NYTimes dataset. Additionally, we develop multiple intuitive evaluation strategies of temporal word embeddings. Our qualitative and quantitative tests indicate that our method not only reliably captures this evolution over time, but also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art temporal embedding approaches on both semantic accuracy and alignment quality.},
