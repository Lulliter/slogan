Tante, troppe volte l’indignazione delle masse e’ stata indirizzata contro bersagli fittizzi o sproporzionati, che non hanno prodotto altro effetto che generare sfiducia socaile verso le autorita costituite, i partiti e le istituzioni (p. 104, 105)"

    "text": "I was really struck the first time I realized how the Latin motto I had heard since childhood: “Mens sana in corpore sano”, was actually a partial quotation used in 1861 by the Englishman John Hulley, as a motto for his Liverpool Athletic Club. In fact, it was extrapolated from a longer sentence by Juvenal poet: “Orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano” (Satire X, 356). Taken in its entirety, the statement has quite a different meaning than its widely used shortened version: for one thing, it referred to prayer and not to sport.\nI have seen this same dynamic (the meaning of words/phrases progressively detaching from the reality they originally described) at work also in the field of public policy, so I decided to dig deeper.\n\n\nThe important question is “Why” such a deviation from the original meaning of a word/sentence may occur. Granted, languages evolve on their own, but it can also be subject to manipulation, as George Orwell’s “1984” so powerfully depicted illustrating the rules and purpose of fictional Oceania nation’s newspeak. The risks connected to this potential abuse of language are clearly laid out by Riccardo Garbini in his “Lessico - Uscire da Babele” (Garbini 2003) 1\n\n\nIn some cases the deviation of the meaning is evidenced by the pure and simple suppression of the term (1984): in such cases, therefore, the analysis does not insist on the reductionist aspect. The deviations, where present, are dictated above all by ideological intentions, that is, by the superimposition of an interpretative grid with rather rigid meshes on the objective data of reality. The effect of the superimposition of this interpretative grid called ideology thus results in a reduction of the perceptive and interpretative field of reality. For this reason semantic deviations have been called ‘reductionisms’.\n\n\n\n\nBesides investigating the origin, it would be equally important to understand the consequence of a lamented lessical approximation or reduction. In fact, quoting Giovanni Gentile’s “Sommario di pedagogia come scienza filosofica”: “Language is not a garment of thought: it is its own body” (Garbini 2003, p3), that is language does not merely communicate our ideas to others, but it is also the tool of our thought, the wings for it to fly."

In classical rhetoric, an adage is also known as a rhetorical proverb or paroemia. Often it’s a type of metaphor. It can express the values of a culture. (Nordquist 2018)\n\nExample(s): “The early bird gets the worm”, “Better late than never.”\n\n\n\nSlogan\nThe English word slogan has a Scottish Gaelic origin and derives from the combination of sluagh (army) + gairm (shout), i.e. a “battle cry”. Nowadays, it signifies a short, memorable and concise phrase used for marketing or political campaigns. Marketing slogans are often called taglines in the United States\n\nExample(s): “…”, “…”"

    "text": "Issues of modern English\nBelow is the list of red flags detected in Orwell’s “Politics and the English Language”(Orwell 1946):\n\nDying metaphors, or worn−out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves. \nOperators, or verbal false limbs, which save the trouble of picking out appropriate verbs and nouns, and at the same time pad each sentence with extra syllables which give it an appearance of symmetry. Characteristic phrases are: render inoperative, militate against, prove unacceptable, make contact with, be subjected to, give rise to, give grounds for, having the effect of, play a leading part (role) in, make itself felt, take effect, exhibit a tendency to, serve the purpose of, etc.\nPretentious diction (used to dress up simple statements and give an air of scientific impartiality to biased judgments), foreign words and expressions, jargon\nMeaningless words, as in certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, where they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so by the reader (like romantic, plastic, values, human, dead, sentimental, natural, vitality), it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning. Many political words are similarly abused: The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice, have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different.\n\n\nMa si possono riscontrare anche\n\nstatalismo\nburocraticismo\n\n\n\nlo stesso linguaggio burocratico, che permea la scuola statale (impropriamente detta ‘pubblica’) italiana odierna, come diretta conseguenza dell’ideologia statalista presenta una forma che è «astratta, solenne, tecnicizzata, in funzione del prestigio e del potere che detiene il diffusore del messaggio. Da questa prassi consegue una sclerosi del pensiero che si sorregge sui trampoli di locuzioni fruste e cristallizzate. Ufficialità, reticenza e straniamento sono i caratteri che il messaggio assume nell’esercizio del potere. (Garbini 2003, p5)"
