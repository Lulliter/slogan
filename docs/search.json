    "text": "I was really struck the first time I realized how the Latin motto I had heard since childhood: “Mens sana in corpore sano”, was actually a partial quotation used in 1861 by the Englishman John Hulley, as a motto for his Liverpool Athletic Club. In fact, it was extrapolated from a longer sentence by Juvenal poet: “Orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano” (Satire X, 356). Taken in its entirety, the statement has quite a different meaning than its widely used shortened version: for one thing, it revolved around prayer and not fitness!\nI have seen this same dynamic (the meaning of words/phrases progressively detaching from the reality or from their originally intended purpose) at work also in the field of public policy, so I decided to dig deeper.\nIn fact, quoting Giovanni Gentile’s “Sommario di pedagogia come scienza filosofica”: “Language is not a garment of thought: it is its own body” (Garbini 2003, p3), i.e. language does not merely communicate our ideas to others, but it is also the tool of our thought, the wings for it to fly.  D’Auria put it in another way (D’Auria 2024), asserting that language is “performative”, in that it colors, deforms, produces reality. For this reason, it is necessarily a divisive instrument because, as soon as it is able to categorize, it is also capable of separating (good from bad, truth from lie, etc.). Knowledge itself, as much as it may scare the proponents of political correctness, lives on categories and categories, including linguistic ones, must precisely distinguish and correctly identify the ontological characteristics of what we are talking about.\n\n\nThe important question is “WHY” does such a deviation from the original meaning of a word/sentence occur?. Granted, languages evolve on their own, but it can also be subject to manipulation, as George Orwell’s “1984” so powerfully depicted illustrating the rules and purpose of fictional Oceania nation’s newspeak. The risks connected to this potential abuse of language are clearly laid out by Riccardo Garbini in his “Lessico - Uscire da Babele” (Garbini 2003, 4) 1\n\n\nIn some cases the deviation of the meaning is evidenced by the pure and simple suppression of the term (1984): in such cases, therefore, the analysis does not insist on the reductionist aspect. The deviations, where present, are dictated above all by ideological intentions, that is, by the superimposition of an interpretative grid with rather rigid meshes on the objective data of reality. The effect of the superimposition of this interpretative grid called ideology thus results in a reduction of the perceptive and interpretative field of reality. For this reason semantic deviations have been called ‘reductionisms’.\n\n\n\n\nAssuming that we may, at least, form hypotheses on why this “reduction” occurs, “HOW does the the deviation from reality (in the language common use) sparkle and then spread?” Can we detect the mechanisms?\n\n\n\nBesides investigating the origin, it would be equally important to understand the consequences of a lamented lessical approximation or reduction."

Over history, it has been mainly applied to sacred or juridical texts. Two are the main approaches: 1. reconstructing the original intention of the authors 2. adapting the interpretation based on the person who receives the text\nexegesis: from Greek \\(ἐξήγησις\\) - exégesis - deriving from the verb \\(ἐξηγέομαι\\) (exegéomai, ~ bring out) - indicates “studying to explain”, but referring to the maximum level of depth is seeked (hence it is referred to sacred or normaitive texts for which every nuance can be poignant).\nphilology: from Greek \\(ϕιλολογία\\) - philologĭa - composed from \\(φίλος\\)- phìlos and \\(λόγος\\) - lògos - indicates literally interest/love for the word/reason. The term indicates the study of texts and their history, but changed a little with the Latin philologia, and later embraced the sense of ‘love of literature’.\nlinguistics\n\n…"

In classical rhetoric, an adage is also known as a rhetorical proverb or paroemia. Often it’s a type of metaphor. It can express the values of a culture. (Nordquist 2018)\n\nExample(s): “The early bird gets the worm”, “Better late than never.”\n\n\n\nSlogan\nThe English word slogan has a Scottish Gaelic origin and derives from the combination of sluagh (army) + gairm (shout), i.e. a “battle cry”. Nowadays, it signifies a short, memorable and concise phrase used for marketing or political campaigns. Marketing slogans are often called taglines in the United States\n\nExample(s): “…”, “…”"

    "text": "Issues of modern English\nBelow is the list of red flags detected in Orwell’s “Politics and the English Language”(Orwell 1946):\n\nDying metaphors, or worn−out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves. \nOperators, or verbal false limbs, which save the trouble of picking out appropriate verbs and nouns, and at the same time pad each sentence with extra syllables which give it an appearance of symmetry. Characteristic phrases are: render inoperative, militate against, prove unacceptable, make contact with, be subjected to, give rise to, give grounds for, having the effect of, play a leading part (role) in, make itself felt, take effect, exhibit a tendency to, serve the purpose of, etc.\nPretentious diction (used to dress up simple statements and give an air of scientific impartiality to biased judgments), foreign words and expressions, jargon\nMeaningless words, as in certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, where they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so by the reader (like romantic, plastic, values, human, dead, sentimental, natural, vitality), it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning. Many political words are similarly abused: The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice, have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different.\n\n\nMa si possono riscontrare anche\n\nstatalismo\nburocraticismo\n\n\n\nlo stesso linguaggio burocratico, che permea la scuola statale (impropriamente detta ‘pubblica’) italiana odierna, come diretta conseguenza dell’ideologia statalista presenta una forma che è «astratta, solenne, tecnicizzata, in funzione del prestigio e del potere che detiene il diffusore del messaggio. Da questa prassi consegue una sclerosi del pensiero che si sorregge sui trampoli di locuzioni fruste e cristallizzate. Ufficialità, reticenza e straniamento sono i caratteri che il messaggio assume nell’esercizio del potere. (Garbini 2003, p5)"

    "text": "SVILUPPO (ECONOMICO) SOSTENIBILE\n\nDa dove viene\nNel 1972, la conferenza ONU sull’ “Ambiente Umano” (Stoccolma, 5-16 giugno 1972) è considerata la prima in cui (almeno i …. paesi presenti) prendono in considerazione il problema della conservazione dell’ambiente e della gestione delle risrse naturali come questione fondamentale. La conferenza promulga un DICHIARAZIONE con 7 proclami e 26 Principi. Qualche stralcio:\n(non ho piu visto questa definizione) &gt; “human environment”\n\nProclama 5: The natural growth of population continuously presents problems for the preservation of the environment, and adequate policies and measures should be adopted, as appropriate, to face this problems. Of all things in teh world, people are the most precious.\n\n\nPronciple 2: The natural resources of the earth, including the air, water, land, flora and fauna and especially representative samples of natural ecosustems, must be safeguarded for the benefit of present and future generations through careful planning or management\n\n(controversa la discussione se la crescita demografica sia un problmea o noma questo finisce nelle raccomandazioni) &gt; Principle 16: Demographic policies which are without prejudcie to basic human rights and which are deemed appropriate by Governments concerned should be applied in those regions where the rate of populatioon growth or excessive population concentration are likely to have adverse effects on the environemnr of the human environment and impede development\n\nRecommendation 12: I. It is recommended that the World Health Organization and other United Nations agencies should provide increased assistance to Governments which so request in the field of family planning programmes without delay. 2. It is further recommended that the World Health Organization should promote and intensify research endeavour in the field of human reproduction, so that the serious consequences of population explosion on human environment can be prevented.\n\n\nConclusions: 48. Many speakers, from both developing and developed countries, agreed that the ruthless pursuit of gross national product, without consideration for other factors, produced conditions of life that were an affront to the dignity of man. The requirements of clean air, water, shelter and health were undeniable needs and rights of man.\n\n\n\n[POPULAZION] Several speakers expressed regret that population problems took so minor a place in the agenda of the Conference. They argued that all strategies for develop- ment and environment would be fatally damaged unless the rate of population increase was reduced. Other speakers said that the population increase was not the problem; the real challenge was the fact that so large a number of the people of the world had such a small expectation for a fruitful, happy and long life. In the opinion of certain delegations there was no incompatibility between population growth and preservation of the environment.\n\n\n\n\nUna definizione vera e propria?\nIl concetto di “sviluppo sostenibile” appare per la prima volta nel 1987, nel cosiddetto rapporto Brundtland del 1987 presentato alla Commissione mondiale per l’ambiente e lo sviluppo denominato anche “Our Common Future” guidata da Gro Harlem Brundtland. Qui si menzionano:\n\nuno sviluppo che deve avere dei limiti\n\n\nHumanity has the ability to make development sustainable to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\nThe concept of sustainable development does imply limits - not absolute limits but limitations imposed by the present state of technology and social organization on environmental resources and by the ability of the biosphere to absorb the effects of human activities. (Environment and Development. 1987, 16)\n\n\nuno sviluppo che adotta stili di vita diversi in base alla ricchezza del paese\n\n\nSustainable global development requires that those who are more affluent adopt life-styles within the planet’s ecological means - in their use of energy, for example. Further, rapidly growing populations can increase the pressure on resources and slow any rise in livingstandards; thus sustainable development can only be pursued if population size and growth are in harmony with the changing productive potential of the ecosystem. (Environment and Development. 1987, 17)\n\n\nuno sviluppo che considera il futuro\n\n\nsustainable development is not a fixed state of harmony, but rather a process of change in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments, the orientation of technological development, and institutional change are made consistent with future as well as present needs. (Environment and Development. 1987, 17)\n\n\nuno sviluppo che considera “poggia” su precisi indirizzi politici\n\n\nWe do not pretend that the process is easy or straightforward. Painful choices have to be made. Thus, in the final analysis, sustainable development must rest on political will. (Environment and Development. 1987, 17)\n\n\nla crescita della popolazione e’ superiore alle risorse disponibili\n\n\nThe issue is not just numbers of people, but how those numbers relate to available resources. Thus the ‘population problem’ must be dealt with in part by efforts to eliminate mass poverty, in order to assure more equitable access to resources, and by education to improve human potential to manage those resources. Urgent steps are needed to limit extreme rates of population growth… providing people with facilities and education that allow them to choose the size of their families is a way of assuring - especially for women - the basic human right of self-determination. (Environment and Development. 1987, 18)\n\n\nla crescita della popolazione e’ un problema IN CERTI LUOGHI\n\n\nOur human world of 5 billion must make room in a finite environment for another human world. The population could stabilize at between 8 and 14 billion sometime next century, according to UN projections. More than 90 per cent of the increase will occur in the poorest countries, and 90 per cent of that growth in already bursting cities.(Environment and Development. 1987, 13)\n\nSince that time, sustainable development has emerged as a core idea of international development theory and policy. However, some experts have criticized certain features of the concept, including:\n\nIts generality or vagueness, which has led to a great deal of debate over which forms or aspects of development qualify as “sustainable”\nIts lack of quantifiable or objectively measurable goals\nIts assumption of the inevitability and desirability of industrialization and economic development\nIts failure to ultimately prioritize human needs or environmental commitments, either of which may reasonably be considered more important in certain circumstances\n\n\n\nQuali assunti contiene\n\npopolazione\nLo stesso Economist diceva che ESG mette insieme 3 concetti disparati e (potenzialmente) in contraddizione (The Economist 2022)\npossono organi consultivi (o di indirizzo politico) dare direttive tecniche (con tanto di deadline) su temi sui quali non sono d’accordo nemmeno gli scienziati specialisti?\nnucleare no ma fotovoltaico si\n\n\n\nQuali principi dovrebbe contenere\n\nLCA ?\nintensita di energia?\n\n\n\nDove arriva\na cose molto concrete dove frasi un po vagheggianti spostano some dollari estremamente sonanti\n\nDirettive\nNel 2001, l’UE ha adottato una strategia a favore dello “sviluppo sostenibile” e successivamente ha introdotto il concetto in altri documenti, incluso l’Articolo (3) del Trattato sull’Unione Europea.\nIn 2015 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which included 17 sweeping goals designed to create a globally equitable society alongside a thriving environment.\n\n\nESG\n\n\nONG l’anello debole e piu ricattabile\nxche on the receiving end of funding\n\n\n\nIndirizzo politico o diktat tecnico?\nLa catena principi - obiettivi - metodi - tecnologie\nAbbiamo i proncipi? e se si li stiamo perdendo di vista?\n\nLe direttive non sono neutrali\nvedi come devi produrre le auto per"
