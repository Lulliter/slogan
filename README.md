+ Clean up the code in: 

+ Make `TL;DR` in **BLOG** less about input and more about output   

## In `analysis/01b_WB_project_pdo_EDA.qmd`
   - revise the OLD plot -> NEW plot thing

## In `analysis/01c_WB_project_pdo_prep.qmd`

+  Study the theory of Lasso Regr and Classification with ML on Gabor's book

+ re-write the attempted models in more condensed form
+ tell in plain English the choices available for improving ML pred perormance (even if not run)
   + defining data / sample for analysis (preprocessing)
   + defining/label engineering of  y
   + feature engineering of x (dealing with missing data %, what x and in what functional form)
   + model selection
   + model hyperparameters tuning
