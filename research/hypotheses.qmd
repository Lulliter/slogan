# Research questions {#sec-RQ}

In general, a **research question's** nature depends on the goal and type of the pursued analysis [See fig 3.9 in @francom_introduction_2024]: 


::: {#tbl-analysis-analysis-types tbl-colwidths="[15, 19, 22, 22, 22]"}

| Type | Aims | Approach | Methods | Evaluation |
|------|------|----------|---------|------------|
| **Exploratory** | Explore: gain insight | Inductive, data-driven, and iterative | Descriptive, pattern detection with machine learning (unsupervised) | Associative |
| **Predictive** | Predict: validate associations | Semi-deductive, data-/ theory-driven, and iterative | Predictive modeling with machine learning (supervised) | Model performance, feature importance, and associative |
| **Inferential** | Explain: test hypotheses | Deductive, theory-driven, and non-iterative | Hypothesis testing with statistical tests | Causal |

Overview of analysis types
:::


## *EXPLORATORY* Research questions  

### Question 1.1 {#sec-RQ11}
***Is there a pattern in the WBG project document corpus[^1] that shows non random variation in the incidence of certain words, phrases, or policy *concepts*[^2] over time?*** 

[^1]: *WBG project document* observed in this case are Project Development Objectives (PDO) descriptive short texts. 
[^2]: *Concepts* encompasse "policy focus", "sector", "strategy" or "emerging priority" in the arena of funding for development  ....

### Hypothesis

The hypothesis being tested here is that the WBG project document corpus shows a non-random variation in the incidence of certain policy concepts over time. 

The launch of a "policy slogan" carries intrinsic motivations to shift the PDO in a certain direction. 

+ This question will be handled in a data-driven way, i.e. starting from patterns observed in the text data and not from predetermined ideas. 
   <!-- + (i.e. I see that after 2020, the word "pandemic" and "vaccine" peaks within PDOs' texts, so I will look for a correlation with the COVID-19 pandemic shock, instead of the other way around). -->

### Question 1.2 {#sec-RQ12}
***Could the WDR[^3] publications "explain" or at least have a correlation to the recurrence over time of said concepts?***  



[^3]: *WDRs* (World Development Reports) are the flagship reports of the World Bank group that have been published annually since 1978.


### Hypothesis
The "alternative" hypothesis being tested here is that the WDR has a "traction effect" on the PDO of the following FYs.


### Question 1.3 {#sec-RQ13}
***Since the WBG project document corpus data are very incomplete when it comes to `sector` and `theme` tagging: is it possible to overcome the insufficient data completion using TOPIC MODELING?***  

### Hypothesis

The hypothesis being tested here is that some ML techniques can help improving the quality of the "document data collection", e.g. the poor and incomplete sector/theme tagging of the WBG project documents.

+ Note that for this purpose the available dataset (~ 20 fiscal years worth of project PDOs descriptions) has been splitted into a training + validation + test sets.

> For the moment, the study's aim is mainly to **EXPLORE** (e.g., trends over time in phrases occurrence), and possibly to **PREDICT** (e.g., use ML to enhance the quality of metadata variables). 
Possible follow-up, also depending on the results of the previous exploratory questions.

## *EXPLANATORY* Research questions 
...

<!-- The important question is ***"WHY" does such a deviation from the original meaning of a word/sentence occur?***. Granted, languages evolve on their own, but it can also be subject to manipulation, as George Orwell's "1984" so powerfully depicted illustrating the rules and purpose of fictional Oceania nation's *newspeak*.  -->
<!-- The risks connected to this potential abuse of language are clearly laid out by Riccardo Garbini in his "Lessico - Uscire da Babele" [@garbini_uscire_2003, p.4] [^4]\ -->
<!--  In alcuni casi la deviazione del significato si evidenzia mediante la soppressione pura e semplice del termine (1984): in tali casi dunque l'analisi non insiste sull'aspetto riduzionista. Le deviazioni, laddove presenti, sono dettate soprattutto da intenti ideologici, ossia dalla sovrapposizione di una griglia interpretativa con maglie piuttosto rigide sui dati oggettivi della realtà. L'effetto della sovrapposizione di questa griglia interpretativa chiamata ideologia risulta in tal modo una riduzione del campo percettivo ed interpretativo della realtà. Per questa ragione le deviazioni semantiche sono state denominate 'riduzionismi'.  -->  

<!-- [^4]: Annex to the Giuseppe Fioravanti's book [@fioravanti_pedagogia_2006] -->

<!--  *In some cases the deviation of the meaning is evidenced by the pure and simple suppression of the term (1984): in such cases, therefore, the analysis does not insist on the reductionist aspect. **The deviations, where present, are dictated above all by ideological intentions, that is, by the superimposition of an interpretative grid with rather rigid meshes on the objective data of reality.** The effect of the superimposition of this interpretative grid called ideology thus results in a reduction of the perceptive and interpretative field of reality. For this reason semantic deviations have been called 'reductionisms'.* -->

<!-- Assuming that we may, at least, form hypotheses on why this "reduction" occurs, then **"HOW" does the the deviation from reality (in the language common use) sparkle and then spread?** Can we detect the mechanisms?  -->

## *PREDICTIVE* Research questions
...
<!-- Besides investigating the origin, it would be equally important to ***understand the consequences of lessical approximation or reduction***. -->
